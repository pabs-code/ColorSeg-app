## About the Project

**Color Segmentation App** is a simple yet powerful Streamlit application that allows users to upload an image and detect segments of specific colors (Red, Green, Blue) using the **HSV color space**. The app is ideal for learning about image processing and OpenCV.

This project is designed to be **easy to use**, **educational**, and **extendable** for more advanced color detection or segmentation tasks.

---

## Features

- Upload images in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format.
- Detect and display segments of Red, Green, and Blue colors in the image.
- Visualize the original image alongside segmented color regions.
- Built with **Streamlit**, **OpenCV**, and **NumPy** for performance and clarity.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- [OpenCV (cv2)](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

---

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/img-hsv-colorseg.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd img-hsv-colorseg
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash

   pip install streamlit opencv-python numpy
   ```

---

## Running Script

1. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. A new browser window will open with the Color Segmentation App.

3. Use the file uploader to select an image (JPG, JPEG, or PNG).

4. The app will display:
   - The original image.
   - Segmented images for Red, Green, and Blue.
